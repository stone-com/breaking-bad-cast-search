# Breaking Bad Character Search App

This is a simple react app that uses the free Breaking Bad API. Users are able to search for specific characters and get info such as name, occupation, nicknames, and season appearances.

This project uses React, axios, and the context api for simple state management.

Created for personal practice with React and Axios.
